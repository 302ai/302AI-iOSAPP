        <h2>Chapter 1 General Provisions</h2>
        <p>Article 1 302.AI ("302.AI", "we" or "us") operates the website 302.AI ("this Website") and provides users with an enterprise-level AI platform based on pay-as-you-go usage. 302.AI will provide users with an application store for direct online use and API services that require configuration and development.</p>
        <p>Article 2 The ownership, operation right and management right of 302.AI belong to 302.AI.</p>
        <p>Article 3 The final interpretation right of this Agreement belongs to 302.AI.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2 PTC Purchase Rules</h2>
        <p>Article 4 PTC is a virtual currency provided by 302.AI for you to make relevant purchases on 302.AI. You may use PTC to freely purchase various products or services on 302.AI. However, PTC cannot be exchanged for RMB or any other currency. You shall purchase the corresponding amount of PTC based on your actual needs.</p>
        <p>Article 5 You may purchase PTC through channels such as the 302.AI APP and the 302.AI official website: https://302.ai/.</p>
        <p>Article 6 As of the date of signing this Agreement, the rules for purchasing PTC with RMB are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 PTC = 1 USD ≈ 7 RMB</li>
            <li>5 PTC = 5 USD ≈ 35 RMB</li>
            <li>20 PTC = 20 USD ≈ 140 RMB</li>
            <li>50 PTC = 50 USD ≈ 350 RMB</li>
            <li>100 PTC = 100 USD ≈ 700 RMB</li>
            <li>200 PTC = 200 USD ≈ 1,400 RMB (with 20 PTC as a gift)</li>
            <li>500 PTC = 500 USD ≈ 3,500 RMB (with 50 PTC as a gift)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>302.AI reserves the right to unilaterally change, adjust, suspend or terminate the rules for purchasing PTC with RMB based on relevant legal provisions, requirements of competent authorities, business development and other factors. You agree to unconditionally accept such changes, adjustments, suspensions or terminations of the above purchase rules. 302.AI will notify you of the aforementioned actions through the announcement on 302.AI, and such actions will automatically take effect from the date of announcement without separate individual notice to you. 302.AI shall not bear any liability for any losses caused to you by such actions.</p>
        <p>Article 7 When using the recharge method, you must carefully confirm your account and carefully select relevant operation options. If you suffer damage to your own rights and interests due to incorrect account input, improper operation, or lack of understanding of the recharge billing method (such as recharging to the wrong account or selecting the wrong recharge type), 302.AI will not make any compensation or indemnification.</p>
        <p>Article 8 If you recharge through illegal means or non-designated recharge methods of 302.AI, 302.AI does not guarantee the smooth or correct completion of the recharge. If your rights and interests are damaged as a result, 302.AI will not make any compensation or indemnification. At the same time, 302.AI reserves the right to terminate your 302.AI personal account qualification and the right to use various recharge services at any time.</p>
        <p>Article 9 After successful recharge, the PTC added to your account can be freely used by you on 302.AI, but 302.AI will not provide any refund or reverse exchange service.</p>
        <p>Article 10 If 302.AI discovers a processing error caused by system failure or any other reason, whether it is beneficial to 302.AI or you, 302.AI has the right to correct the error after notifying you via email, WeChat or other reasonable methods. If this measure results in you receiving fewer PTC than you should have, 302.AI will make up the difference to your 302.AI personal account as soon as possible after confirming the processing error. If the error results in you receiving more PTC than you should have, regardless of the nature and cause of the error, 302.AI has the right to directly deduct the difference from your 302.AI personal account.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3 Rights Statement</h2>
        <p>Article 11 You can check your PTC balance on the mobile APP at any time. If you have any objection to the record, you shall immediately raise it to 302.AI. 302.AI will correct it if there is a confirmed error after verification; otherwise, you agree that the transaction records on 302.AI shall be the sole valid basis for PTC transactions.</p>
        <p>Article 12 302.AI has the right to set relevant matters related to transactions from time to time based on considerations such as transaction security, including but not limited to transaction limits and transaction frequency.

        <p>Article 14 When recharging, you shall ensure that you are the holder of the bound Alipay account, that you can use the account legally and effectively, and that you have not infringed the legitimate rights and interests of any third party.

        <p>Article 15 Any losses or liabilities arising from your own reasons that cause 302.AI to be unable to provide PTC purchase services or cause errors in providing PTC purchase services shall be borne by you. 302.AI shall not be liable, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>(1) During the system downtime for maintenance, upgrade or adjustment announced by 302.AI;</li>
            <li>(2) Telecommunications equipment malfunctions and data transmission cannot be performed;</li>
            <li>(3) Force majeure factors such as typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, power outages, wars, terrorist attacks, and government controls cause system failures of 302.AI and prevent the performance of services;</li>
            <li>(4) Service interruptions or delays caused by factors such as hacker attacks, technical adjustments or failures of telecommunications departments, website upgrades, or issues with relevant third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Chapter 4 Penalty Rules</h2>
        <p>Article 17 If any of the following circumstances occurs, 302.AI has the right to interrupt or terminate the provision of online services under this Agreement to you at any time without notifying you: (1) The personal information you provide is untrue; (2) You violate the purchase rules specified in this Agreement. In addition to the circumstances mentioned in the preceding paragraph, 302.AI also reserves the right to interrupt or terminate part or all of the online recharge services at any time without prior notice to you. 302.AI shall not be liable to you or any third party for any losses caused by the interruption or termination of recharge services.</p>
        <p>Article 18 If a user illegally uses a non-personal Apple App Store account for proxy recharge, or illegally purchases PTC through other channels not approved by 302.AI, 302.AI has the right to freeze the account and impose corresponding penalties, and may ban the account in severe cases.</p>
        <p>Article 19 When using 302.AI, if a user violates national laws and regulations, the provisions of the User Registration Agreement, the provisions of the User Redemption Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement, or other management regulations of 302.AI for users, 302.AI has the right to temporarily or permanently ban your account. From the time the account is banned until it is unblocked (if applicable), the remaining PTC in your account will be temporarily frozen or fully deducted, and cannot be continued to be used to purchase virtual products or services on the platform. At the same time, the cash value you paid for purchasing PTC will not be refunded.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 5 Supplementary Provisions</h2>

The revised version will take effect immediately upon announcement and shall also apply to users before its entry into force. If you continue to use the services after the content of this Agreement is revised, you shall be deemed to have agreed to the latest revised Agreement; otherwise, you must immediately stop using the services.</p>

        <p>Article 23 If any part of this Agreement is deemed illegal or invalid by a competent court, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of other parts.</p>
