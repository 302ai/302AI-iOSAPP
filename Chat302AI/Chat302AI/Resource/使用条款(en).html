  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">September 22, 2022</p>

  <p>Welcome to the Terms of Use for 302.AI. This is an agreement between 302.AI, the owner and operator of the 302.AI website and any associated downloadable software or services provided (collectively, the "Platform"), and you ("you," "your"), the user of the Platform. In this agreement, the words "302.AI," "we," "us," and "our" refer to our company, 302.AI. Clicking "I Agree," accessing, or using the Platform signifies that you agree to be bound by this agreement and the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>We may modify our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy and may not notify you when we do so. The current version of this agreement can be found on our website. You understand and agree that you have an obligation to review these terms and conditions from time to time to stay informed of current rules and obligations. Your continued use of the Platform after any revisions to the Platform or this agreement signifies your full and irrevocable acceptance of any and all such changes. Please note that arbitration and class action provisions may affect your rights. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, please cease using our Platform immediately.</p>

  <p>302.AI has developed, owns, and provides a service that enables anonymous internet browsing by redirecting user communications to devices of other users (the "System"). This may be used for commercial purposes under this agreement. During the term of this agreement, 302.AI grants you a license to access and use the System solely for the purpose of your internal business operations. 302.AI reserves any and all rights not expressly granted in this agreement, including but not limited to any and all rights to the System.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">User Information and Accounts</h2>
  <p>Before accessing certain parts of the Platform, users may need to register on the Platform. We will collect and disclose your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. All users must provide truthful and accurate information when registering for our Platform and must be at least 18 years of age. Each user may only register one account. We reserve the right to verify all user credentials and reject any user.</p>

  <p>You are fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account and for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify 302.AI immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. 302.AI is not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, with or without your knowledge.</p>

  <p>If you are registering on behalf of your company, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your company to create an account on its behalf, and you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your company to assume financial obligations and enter into legally binding agreements on behalf of your company.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Services</h2>
  <p>Through the Platform, 302.AI may provide proxy services or other services. These services may be provided via the internet or through downloadable software. If you download a copy of our software, you agree to comply with this agreement.</p>

  <p>302.AI makes reasonable efforts to provide these services to you; however, all services provided depend on numerous factors and variables beyond 302.AI's direct control. For these reasons, all services provided are not guaranteed and are provided "as is." When you choose to use any services provided by the Platform, you agree that we make no warranties, including but not limited to access or efficiency.</p>

  <p>You understand that the services provided may have variances, inaccuracies, negative effects, or be incorrect. You agree to hold us harmless from any liability we may incur as a result of providing you with any services offered through the Platform. You agree that any services or any other information found on the Platform may be inaccurate, unverified, or even incorrect. You agree to hold us harmless from any liability we may incur as a result of your use of our Platform.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">User Content</h2>
  <p>Your ability to submit or transmit any information through the Platform, including but not limited to data, information, images, references, or any other information, is collectively referred to as "User Content" in this agreement. Please note that we are not required to host, display, migrate, or distribute any of your User Content, and we may refuse to accept or transmit any User Content.</p>

  <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for any User Content you submit, and you hold us harmless from any liability related to the submission of any User Content. We provide industry-standard security for our Platform, but we cannot guarantee absolute security for any such User Content. Any User Content found to violate this agreement or that we determine is harmful to the Platform may be modified, edited. When submitting any User Content to our Platform, you represent and warrant that you own all rights to the User Content and that you have paid for or have the right to use any User Content submitted.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, you represent and warrant that all User Content is legal and that the User Content does not interfere with any third-party rights or obligations. When you submit any User Content to us, you grant 302.AI, its partners, affiliates, users, representatives, and assignees a non-exclusive, limited, fully paid, royalty-free, revocable, worldwide, universal, transferable, assignable license to display, distribute, store, broadcast, transmit, reproduce, modify, prepare derivatives, or use and reuse your User Content in whole or in part to provide you with any services related to the Platform. Additionally, you grant 302.AI a global, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Platform any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, corrections, or other feedback you provide related to the operation of our Platform.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We value your privacy and understand your privacy concerns. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into this agreement and governs your access to and use of the Platform. Please review our Privacy Policy so that you are aware of our privacy practices. All information we collect is subject to our Privacy Policy, and using the Platform signifies your consent to all actions we take with your information in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>You further understand that any information collected by 302.AI may be transferred outside your jurisdiction of residence and/or to other countries for storage, processing, and use by 302.AI and its affiliates.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Platform Availability</h2>
  <p>Although we attempt to provide continuous availability to you, we do not guarantee that the Platform will always be available, functioning, or accessible at any particular time. Furthermore, 302.AI has no obligation to provide services to any user and may suspend a user's access to the Platform at any time at its sole discretion. Only users eligible to use our Platform may do so, and we may refuse service or terminate your access at any time. We cannot guarantee that anything found on our Platform will meet your required functionality or provide you with any desired results.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Platform Modifications</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to change, modify, update, or remove our Platform at any time. We may, at our sole discretion, make such modifications to our Platform for security reasons, intellectual property, legal reasons, or various other reasons, and we are not required to explain such modifications. For example, we may provide updates to fix security vulnerabilities or respond to legal requirements. Please note that this is a non-binding illustration of how we may exercise the rights set forth in this section, and nothing in this section obligates us to take measures to update the Platform for security, legal, or other purposes.</p>

  <p>Pricing for any services is listed on the 302.AI proxy platform. 302.AI may increase the price of any service at its sole discretion, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If a price increase occurs, 302.AI will notify you, and you will have the opportunity to accept or refuse any price increase. If you intend to refuse a price increase, please notify us. If you refuse a price increase, you may not be able to access certain parts of the Platform.

  <p>Liability may arise through third parties transmitting to or through our Platform, any intentional or unintentional service failure or interruption, or any action related to any third-party copyright or other intellectual property owner. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
