  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">September 22, 2022</p>

  <p>302.AI operates in the data business, therefore we place great importance on data privacy. We provide clean, compliant, and ethical data for customers and businesses while maintaining the highest privacy standards. Our products and services operate globally, so we continuously monitor the dynamic global privacy environment and make adjustments accordingly to ensure full compliance with privacy laws. This privacy policy applies both to users who actively choose to use our services (as described below) and to individuals whose personal data we may process in the course of our operations.</p>

  <p>Feel free to read the detailed breakdown of our privacy policy at any time, or contact us with any questions about our policies or data regulation compliance.</p>

  <p>302.AI ("302.AI", "we" or "us") operates the website 302.AI ("this website") and any accompanying services, features, content, and applications (collectively referred to as "services"). We care about your privacy and have designed this privacy policy to help you decide whether to use the services and to provide all necessary information about our privacy practices. By accessing and using the services, or otherwise providing information to us, you agree to and accept the terms of this privacy policy as revised from time to time, and consent to the collection and use of information as described herein. We encourage you to carefully review this privacy policy and refer to it regularly to understand it and any subsequent changes made to it. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy, please stop using the services immediately and delete where relevant.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">What types of information do we collect?</h2>
  <p>When you use our services, we collect the following types of data from you ("User Data"):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-Personal Information. This is information generated by user activities that cannot identify and is not identifiable to an individual. Such non-personal information may include the following - browser type, pages you visit, time spent on those pages, visit time and date.</li>
    <li>Personal Information. Personal information is information that identifies you or may identify you. The personal information we collect and retain includes your IP address, your name and email address, payment and billing information, or other information we may require from time to time during the onboarding process and as necessary for service provision. When you create an account on our services, you may use your credentials from designated third-party websites or services ("Third-Party Accounts") such as GmailÂ®. Doing so will enable you to link your account with your third-party account. If you choose this option, a third-party account pop-up will appear requiring your approval to proceed, which will describe the types of information we will obtain. This information includes your personal information stored in your third-party account, such as username, email address, profile picture. Any specifically connected anonymous information or information linked to any personal information will be treated as personal information by us as long as such connection or linkage exists.</li>
    <li>Registration via Social Network Accounts: When you register or log in to our services through your social network account (e.g., Facebook, Google+), we will have access to basic information from your social network account, such as your email address, and any other information you have made public or consented to share with us on that account. At all times, we comply with the terms, conditions, and restrictions of the social network platforms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If we combine non-personal information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information. We may also collect publicly available personal data from various online sources. In most cases, such information will include basic contact details such as name, email ("Public Data").</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>Processing of User Data is necessary for fulfilling our contractual obligations to you and providing our services to you, protecting our legitimate interests, and complying with our legal obligations.</p>
  <p>Processing of Public Data is conducted based on our legitimate interests, provided that such interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">How do we use your information?</h2>
  <p>We use User Data to provide you with our services and to comply with our legal requirements and internal guidelines.

  <p>Notwithstanding the above, we do not disclose your IP address to other customers. However, your IP address may be visible to other customers (e.g., other peers in the network) when they use your IP address to access the network, for example, by looking up their current IP address.</p>
  <p>We may also share your personal information and other information in special circumstances if we have good reason to believe it is necessary: (1) To comply with laws, regulations, subpoenas, or court orders.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Access to Personal Information</h2>
  <p>You may request, up to once per year, that we disclose to you the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which your personal information was collected, and the business purpose for collection (if applicable). Deletion Requests You have the right to request that we delete any personal information collected from you and retained by us, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers, subcontractors, and advisors to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Exercising Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may exercise your rights (such as access and deletion) by submitting a verifiable consumer request to our email address: luna@302.AI. Only you, or a person legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a consumer request related to your personal information. The request must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    <li>If we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you, we will not be able to respond to your request or provide you with personal information. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Response Timing and Format</h2>
  <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing within the first 45 days. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request. Where reasonably possible, we will provide your personal information in a readily usable format that should allow you to transmit the information without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. If a request is denied, the response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with your request. Please note that these rights are not absolute, and requests are subject to any applicable legal requirements, including legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Non-Discrimination</h2>
  <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights as a consumer. We will not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
    <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
    <li>Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
    <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
  </ul>
